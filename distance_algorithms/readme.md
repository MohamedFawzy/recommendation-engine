# Distance algorithms

## Description : 
- Measure similarity between items/products etc in recommender system can be
  done using three techniques [ machine learning , math models, statistics ]
- similarity calcuations such as Eculidean distance measures .
- Math Models e.g : Matrix factorization .
- Machine learning model such as classification

## Machine learning algorithms
- Supeverised learning .
- UnSupervised learning .
- Classification , clustring , dimensionality reduction .
